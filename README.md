# Sudoku Game 🎮-
A fully functional Sudoku game built with React and Zustand as part of the GDSC NIT Calicut Web Development inductions task. This project allows users to play a classic Sudoku game with features like:

Start/Restart Game: Generate new Sudoku boards dynamically. <br>
Pause/Resume: Take a break anytime and resume from where you left off.
Hints: Get hints for the selected cell.
Timer: Track how long it takes to solve the puzzle.
Mistakes Counter: Keep track of the mistakes made.
Score Calculation: Based on time, mistakes, and hints used.
The application is built with React (for the UI) and uses Zustand for state management. It ensures smooth interactions and state persistence across sessions using Zustand's middleware.

Features 📋
Dynamic Sudoku Boards: Boards are dynamically generated with predefined difficulty.
State Persistence: Game progress is saved using Zustand’s persistence middleware.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices.
Interactive UI: User-friendly interface with buttons for game controls (start, pause, hint, etc.).
Tech Stack 🛠️
Frontend: React, Zustand, Vite
Icons: Lucide React
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: Zustand with persistence middleware
